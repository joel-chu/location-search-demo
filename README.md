There are two parts:

- Demo UI: It's React using [PreactX](https://preactjs.com/) engine (its the same, only much better)
- Server: Koa TS, run without compile stage, using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) that parse TS files in sub-second speed (almost matching Rust based [deno.js](https://deno.land/))
